# TTScaffolding
Generic front-end foundations for most Time Tunnel web projects


## Quick Overview

```sh
cd webapp/

npm i 
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.<br>
When you‚Äôre ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.


or You could generate project by create-react-app command. For example

```sh
npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app my-app
cd my-app/
npm start
```

Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern React app:

* React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
* Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
* A dev server that lints for common errors.
* Import CSS and image files directly from JavaScript.
* Autoprefixed CSS, so you don‚Äôt need `-webkit` or other prefixes.
* A `build` script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with sourcemaps.
* An offline-first [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) and a [web app manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/), meeting all the [Progressive Web App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) criteria.
